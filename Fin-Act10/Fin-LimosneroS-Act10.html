		<h1>Philippines</h1>
		<div class="desc">Often overlooked because of neighbouring beauty Thailand, the Philippines is one of the most stunning countries in the world. It's made up of over 7000 stunning islands in the Pacific Ocean! Palawan in particular has been called the most beautiful island in the world!</div>

			<img alt src="country/chile.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Chile</h1>
		<div class="desc">Chile spans almost from the equator to the sub Antarctic, making it the longest contiguous country in the world as measured by latitude. Crammed into the almost 40 latitude degrees are some of the world's most beautiful places. Last Hope Fjord is one of the most beautiful in the world, and the Atacama desert is astonishing, partly because it is the driest non-ice desert on Earth.

	<div class="gallery">
		<a target="_blank" href="country/india.webp">
			<img alt src="country/india.webp"> </a>
		<h1>India</h1>
		<div class="desc">Home to stunning places like Rajasthan and Goa, India has everything from tropical beaches to the glacier capped Himalayas. From the town of Varanasi, to the great monument of love which is the Taj Mahal, to possibly the finest wildlife offered outside of Africa, the diversity, colors and frequent chaos of this nation can be overwhelming

			<img alt src="country/uganda.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Uganda</h1>
		<div class="desc">The Pearl of Africa" is incredible. Though a small country, it is the starting point of one of the most amazing rivers in the world – and its very longest - the Nile. The river is born in the 'mountains of the moon', more accurately known as the Rwenzoris, which are some of the mountains you've probably never heard of but have to try see! Lake Victoria has been called the most amazing lake on earth.

	<div class="gallery">
		<a target="_blank" href="country/canada.webp">
			<img alt src="country/canada.webp"> </a>

		<a target="_blank" href="country/nepal.webp">
			<img alt src="country/nepal.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Nepal</h1>
		<div class="desc">The mountain country of Nepal is predictably stunning. The capital of Kathmandu is possibly the most famous, and has exceptionally distinctive architecture, but the second largest town of Pokhara is the real jaw-dropper as it is looked upon by some of the tallest mountains on earth, in the Annapurna massif.
		</div>
	</div>



	<div class="gallery">

		<a target="_blank" href="country/norway.webp">
			<img alt src="country/norway.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Norway</h1>
		<div class="desc">Land of trolls and fjords, Norway is one of the most beautiful countries in Europe. While fjords such as Geiranger, Nærøyfjord and Sognefjord dominate the mental images of this Scandinavian gem, the Lofoten Islands are debatably its visual highlight. If you're surprised by the Northern Lights while taking in these stunning sights, your mind may just start playing some Edvard Hagerup Grieg in spontaneous celebration!

			<img alt src="country/switzerland.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Switzerland</h1>
		<div class="desc">Europe's mountain nation encompasses probably the very most beautiful parts of the Alps. The Matterhorn is listed number two on the most incredible mountains in the world list, and the Bernese Oberland makes up some of the most beautiful highlands on earth.

		<a target="_blank" href="country/kenya.webp">
			<img alt src="country/kenya.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Kenya</h1>
		<div class="desc">Land of the Maasai Mara and image of wild Africa. The country has been rated in the top 3 wildlife countries on Earth, and Mount Kenya is the second tallest mountain on the continent. The spectacle of the great migration is one of the greatest in the world, and the views of Kilimanjaro from Amboseli National Park are ironically probably better than from Tanzania itself, in which the great mountain is situated!

	<div class="gallery">
		<a target="_blank" href="country/italy.webp">
			<img alt src="country/italy.webp"> </a>

		<h1>Colombia</h1>
		<div class="desc">This may be an unexpected addition to the top 10, but Colombia deserves its spot!

			<img alt src="country/argentina.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Argentina</h1>
		<div class="desc">She may have wanted the country to hold back its tears, but it's pretty certain Evita shed a few when considering its incredible beauty. From the urban splendor of Buenos Aires, rated one of the most beautiful cities in the world, to the massive expanse of the Pampas, Argentina is a land of evocative beauty. The Iguazu Falls, which straddle, Argentina and Brazil, are generally regarded as one of the two most impressive and beautiful waterfalls in the world – with only Victoria Falls in Zambia / Zimbabwe being rated above it with frequency.

		<div class="desc">The desert nation of Africa is hauntingly beautiful. It's Germanic influence is evident throughout the country, which is one of the world's natural treasure troves. Etosha national park is indisputably one of the world's greatest game reserves. Before the rainy season, it offers wildlife viewing that rivals the very best reserves on Earth.

			<img alt src="country/china.webp"> </a>
		<h1>China</h1>
		<div class="desc">The world's third largest country has some of its finest scenery. The Mekong River is one of the most extraordinary rivers in the world, arising in the vast Tibetan Plateau. This plateau is the largest and highest plateau in the world, with tens of thousands of glaciers including the Rongbuk, Midui and Hailuogou that eventually help feed the Mekong and many other rivers. If regarded as a canyon, the Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon is certainly the largest on Earth, stretching over 300 miles in length and attaining a mind boggling maximum depth of almost 20,000 feet near Mount Namcha Barwa in the Himalayas.

			<img alt  src="country/new zealand.webp"> </a>
		<h1>New Zealand</h1>
		<div class="desc">The "World's Most Beautiful Island-Nation" is so stunning that it even makes the Top 3 for Beautiful Countries. It's hard to know where to begin with such a scenically magnificent place. Wellington has been named one of the ten most beautiful small cities, and Auckland is famously attractive with a host of beaches dotted around its fascinating isthmus setting. Queentown is the obvious 'urban' scenic highlight of the country, because it is so stunningly situated on Lake Wakatipu in the shade of 'The Remarkables' mountain range. It's no wonder it has been named one of the five most beautiful towns in the world.

			<img alt src="country/brazil.webp"> </a>
		<h1>Brazil</h1>
		<div class="desc">The world's most biodiverse country is also its fifth largest. Within such a massive area, it is unsurprising that there are scenic highlights. Foremost is undoubtedly the unparalleled Amazon Rainforest and Amazon River. The Rain Forest is by far the largest on earth, and would be the sixth largest country in the world were it independent. The Pantanal is one of the best wildlife destinations in the world, the Iguazu falls named the second most amazing waterfall in the world, and Rio de Janeiro has been named the second most beautiful city in the world.

Considering how crazy people are about the place, it's not surprising that South Africa takes the top spot in the beauty stakes. Not only does the country have stupendous natural beauty, but it's urban-amazing too. The town of Franschhoek has been named amongst the five loveliest in the world, and the metropolis of Cape Town is more often than not picked as the most beautiful city on earth by travel lists and tourists alike, because of both its unparalleled natural setting and gorgeous architecture.
